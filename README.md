- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tom, thanks for taking an interest in my github.
-    After law studies and a number of experiences working in legal departments, I decided that I wanted to try something new.
-    I chose software engineering mostly because I have always been interested in computers and IT in general since I was teenager thanks to my brother.
-    Although, at that time, I mostly wanted to play Diablo II while he was installing Linux distros on the family computer.


- ðŸŒ± I decided to do The Odin Project to familiarize myself with web development and I can say that I really enjoyed learning along and solving problems. 
-    I started with plain HTML/CSS then JavaScript. After that, I learnt Ruby and Ruby on Rails which was a brand new and challenging experience. 
-    Then I discovered React and it opened so many possibilities, I was light years from the plain JavaScript.

-  Here you will find the many projects I created during the Odin Project curriculum, I am always looking for ways to improve on them and continue learning. 
-  I hope my profile taught you a little bit more about myself and that my github will convince you.

Thanks !
